# ns (nanoseconds) and mcs (microseconds)

Print nanosecond Unix timestamp. Blazingly fast. Written in a few Zig lines.

```
    $ ns
    1737006005004003002

    $ mcs
    1737006005004004
```

On my computer in 2025, `ns` returns only microsecond precision.
However, we may hope that hardware, os, and zig
will return true nanosecond timestamps in the mythical future:

## Build and run ns (nanoseconds)

```
zig build-exe ns.zig -OReleaseFast -fsingle-threaded
./ns
```

## Build and run mcs (microseconds)

```
zig build-exe mcs.zig -OReleaseFast -fsingle-threaded
./mcs
```

## Output (one line)

```
    ns
    1731603603002001000

    -------------- no nanosecond
    -------------- 1 microsecond
    ----------- 2 milliseconds
    -------- 3 seconds

    mcs
    1731603603002001

    ----- 3600 seconds > 1 hour
    - 31557... seconds > 1 year
    17356..... seconds ~ 55 years
```

## Install the executables

To make the `ns` and/or `mcs` executables available as command-line commands,
you can move them to a directory included in your `PATH`. Common choices
are `$HOME/bin` or `$HOME/.local/bin`.

### Step 1: Ensure a `bin` directory exists and is in your `PATH`

If you donâ€™t already have a suitable home `bin` directory,
you can create one and add it to your `PATH`.
Run the following commands (use `.zshrc` for ZSH and `.bashrc` for BASH):

```
mkdir -p $HOME/.local/bin
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Step 2: Move the executables

Once your bin directory is ready and included in your PATH, move one or both executables:

```
mv ns mcs $HOME/.local/bin
```

### Step 3: Verify the installation

Ensure the installed commands are accessible from anywhere by running:

```
ns
mcs
```

If both commands run successfully (each displaying a large integer such as
171234567890...), the installation is complete.
You can now use them like any other command-line utility.
